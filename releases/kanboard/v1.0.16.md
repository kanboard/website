Here are the last improvements made for this version:

### Better time tracking for subtasks

For each subtask, the timer can be stopped/started at any time:

![Subtask timer](https://docs.kanboard.org/images/v1/subtask-time-tracking.png)

The timer starts automatically when you toggle the subtask status.

You can always replace the value calculated by editing the subtask or ignore that if you don't need this feature.

The settings option to enable/disable subtask time tracking is removed. It's always enabled now.

[More information in the documentation](https://docs.kanboard.org/v1/user/time_tracking/)

### Improved email notifications

![Notifications](https://docs.kanboard.org/images/v1/notifications.png)

It's now possible to filter the email notifications, instead of receiving all emails, you can choose between several configurations:

- All tasks
- Only for tasks assigned to you
- Only for tasks created by you
- Only for tasks created by you and assigned to you (the default now)

The email template for task updates have been improved to show the differences.

There is also a direct link to the board in the email footer if you have defined an application URL in your settings.

### New mail transports

It's now possible to send email with the HTTP API of Postmark, Sendgrid and Mailgun. Those integrations were already existing into Kanboard to receive incoming emails.

The main advantage of this method instead of the standard SMTP configuration is the speed. Opening SMTP sessions over TLS is slower than using a simple HTTPS request because the SMTP protocol is more verbose.

### User RSS feeds

Like the iCal subscription, there is now a RSS feed by user. This subscription contains all activity events from the projects of the user.

Note: **The URL of project feed have changed**, don't forget to update your RSS reader.

### Replacement of the chart drawing library

The Javascript library used too draw charts have been replaced by C3JS. Diagrams are easier to generate and they are looking better.

### Update of the Bitbucket webhook

Atlassian have updated the API of Bitbucket. Now, it's possible to receive commits, issues and comments from Bitbucket in Kanboard.

More automatic actions have been added, by example you can add a comment in Kanboard when you commit some changes related to a task.
